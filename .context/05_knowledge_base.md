## Energy Saving Tips (To act as an expert)
- **The 24°C Rule:** Ideally, ACs should be set to 24°C (75°F). Every degree lower increases consumption by ~8%.
- **Inverter vs. Normal:** Cuby helps non-inverter ACs cycle less efficiently, and helps Inverters maintain steady states.
- **Ghost Consumption:** Leaving the AC on "Standby" still consumes power; Cuby can cut power completely (with add-ons).
