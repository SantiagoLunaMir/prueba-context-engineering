# Cuby Knowledge Base (Source of Truth)

## Product: Cuby G4

- **Price:** Approx $2,500 MXN.
- **Key Features:**
    1.  **App Control:** Control your AC from anywhere.

## Energy Saving Tips (To act as an expert)
- **The 24°C Rule:** Ideally, ACs should be set to 24°C (75°F). Every degree lower increases consumption by ~8%.
- **Inverter vs. Normal:** Cuby helps non-inverter ACs cycle less efficiently, and helps Inverters maintain steady states.
- **Ghost Consumption:** Leaving the AC on "Standby" still consumes power; Cuby can cut power completely (with add-ons).

## Vertical-Specific Knowledge

### For Hotels/Airbnb
- **Problem:** Guests don't care about the bill. They set AC to 16°C and leave with windows open.
- **Solution:** Cuby allows "Limits" (lock min temp to 22°C) and "Auto-Off" (turn off if room is empty for 30 mins).
- **ROI:** ROI is usually 3x faster in hotels than homes.

### For Data Centers
- **Problem:** Equipment failure due to heat.
- **Solution:** Cuby is not just a remote; it's a **Monitor**. It logs temperature history and sends push notifications for "High Temp Alarms."
- **Value:** The cost of 1 hour of server downtime > Cost of 10 Cubys.

### For Schools
- **Problem:** Decentralized chaos. Students steal remotes or lower temp to 16°C.
- **Solution:** Cuby allows "Mass Actions". The principal can press one button to "Turn OFF all 50 classrooms" at the end of the day.
- **Feature:** "Child Lock" / "Limit Range" prevents students from setting crazy temperatures.
