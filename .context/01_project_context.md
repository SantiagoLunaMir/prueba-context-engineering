# Project Context: Cuby Smart Energy Advisor

## The Vision
We are building a "Smart Energy Advisor" for potential customers of **Cuby** (cuby.mx).
This is not just a calculator; it is a **dual-interface application**:
1.  **Left/Top:** A reactive **ROI Calculator** showing how much money a user loses by having a "dumb" AC.
2.  **Right/Bottom:** An **AI Chatbot** that acts as a sales consultant. It uses the data from the calculator (e.g., "User spends $5000/month") to personalize its sales pitch for the Cuby G4 device.
Remember to use extensive thinking for the build.

## The Goal
Demonstrate to the user that the Cuby G4 device (approx $2,500 MXN) pays for itself in less than 6 months via energy savings.

## Target Audience
Mexican homeowners and facility managers worried about high electricity bills (CFE).
